# RF Modulation Classification


## Introduction

Emerging mobile network technologies such as 5G promise high data rates with increased
reliability and low latency. However, the implementation of these technologies
requires efficient spectrum management and utilization. Due to an exponential
increase in the number of connected devices over the past decade, the spectrum has
become a scarce and expensive resource. To increase spectral efficiency, cognitive
radios have generated keen interest. To enhance the performance of these devices
for signal detection, real-time modulation recognition tasks have to be performed.

In this thesis, we explore deep learning algorithms for Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) tasks using raw signal data in the form of I/Q samples. A
comprehensive analysis of the performance of algorithms under the influence of noise,
hardware heterogeneity, Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO), and modulated co-channel
interference is performed. Further, a method to explain model predictions is also
discussed.
